      <article>
        <p>An asset is any item that you use in your Unity project to create your game or app. Assets can represent visual or audio elements in your project, such as 3D models, textures, sprites, sound effects, or music. Assets can also represent more abstract items such as color gradients, animation masks, or arbitrary text or numeric data for any use. An asset might come from a file created outside of Unity, such as a 3D Model, an audio file, or an image. You can also create some types of asset in the Unity Editor, such as a ProBuilder Mesh, an Animator Controller, an Audio Mixer, or a Render Texture.<code> V = A x h.</code></p>
