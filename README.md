# Technical Documentation Page

Welcome to the technical documentation webpage for the "Unity" application. This project aims to replicate the structure and design of the original Unity manual for self-learning purposes.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Navigation Bar**: Explore different sections of the documentation with an intuitive and well-organized navigation bar.
- **Faithful Replication**: The format and content closely mirror the original Unity manual, presenting a challenging exercise.

This project is intended to help improve my skills in HTML and CSS by faithfully recreating the Unity manual's layout and style.
